abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and associated advanced liver
  diseases have become prevalent conditions in many countries and are associated with
  increased mortality. Gene expression profiles in NAFLD have been examined recently
  but changes in expression elicited by chemical compound treatments have not been
  investigated. Since (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and atorvastatin (ATST)
  exhibit similar efficacy in NAFLD models, we reasoned that some common key genes
  might alter after treatment of EGCG and ATST. Accordingly, we applied integrated
  bioinformatics analyses of RNA microarray data from EGCG and ATST treatment groups
  compared to controls in a NAFLD phenotypic mouse model. Using differential expression
  (DE) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis,
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and ClueGO enrichment, shared EGCG and ATST
  down-regulated pathways were identified which included extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor
  interaction and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To refine key
  genes associated with liver fibrosis, a human NAFLD signature derived from patients
  of different fibrosis stages was analyzed. The results showed that fibrosis-related
  genes Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1 and Col6a3 were significantly down-regulated. These
  four genes were further validated as down-regulated in an independent mouse NAFLD
  dataset. We conclude that EGCG and ATST treatment results in the significant down-regulation
  of genes related to liver fibrosis.
