abstract: "Objectives: To facilitate disease prognosis and improve precise immunotherapy\
  \ of gastric cancer (GC) patients, a comprehensive study integrating immune cellular\
  \ and molecular analyses on tumor tissues and peripheral blood was performed. Methods:\
  \ The association of GC patients' outcomes and the immune context of their tumors\
  \ was explored using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and transcriptome profiling.\
  \ Potential immune dysfunction mechanism/s in the tumors on the systemic level was\
  \ further examined using mass cytometry (CyTOF) in complementary peripheral blood\
  \ from selected patients. GC cohorts with mIHC and gene expression profiling data\
  \ were also used as validation cohorts. Results: Increased CD4+FOXP3+ T-cell density\
  \ in the GC tumor correlated with prolonged survival. Interestingly, CD4+FOXP3+\
  \ T cells had a close interaction with CD8+ T cells rather than tumor cells. High\
  \ densities of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (High-High) independently predicted\
  \ prolonged patient survival. Furthermore, the interferon-gamma (IFN-$Î³$) gene signature\
  \ and PDL1 expression were up-regulated in this group. Importantly, a subgroup of\
  \ genomically stable (GS) tumors and tumors with chromosomal instability (CIN) within\
  \ this High-High group also had excellent survival. The High-High GS/CIN tumors\
  \ were coupled with increased frequencies of Tbet+CD4+ T cells and central memory\
  \ CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood. Conclusion: These novel findings identify\
  \ the combination of CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+CD4+ T cells as a significant prognostic\
  \ marker for GC patients, which also could potentially be targeted and applied in\
  \ the combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockades in precision medicine."
