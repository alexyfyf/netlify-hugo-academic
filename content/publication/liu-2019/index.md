abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in host defense after recognition
  of conserved microbial- and host-derived components, and their dysregulation is
  a common feature of various inflammation-associated cancers, including gastric cancer
  (GC). Despite the recent recognition that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark
  of cancer, the molecular effectors of altered metabolism during tumorigenesis remain
  unclear. Here, using bioenergetics function assays on human GC cells, we reveal
  that ligand-induced activation of TLR2, predominantly through TLR1/2 heterodimer,
  augments both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, with a bias toward
  glycolytic activity. Notably, DNA microarray-based expression profiling of human
  cancer cells stimulated with TLR2 ligands demonstrated significant enrichment of
  gene-sets for oncogenic pathways previously implicated in metabolic regulation,
  including reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 and Myc. Moreover, the redox gene encoding
  the manganese-dependent mitochondrial enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, was strongly
  induced at the mRNA and protein levels by multiple signaling pathways downstream
  of TLR2, namely JAK-STAT3, JNK MAPK and NF-$Ä…ppa$B. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated
  suppression of SOD2 ameliorated the TLR2-induced metabolic shift in human GC cancer
  cells. Importantly, patient-derived tissue microarrays and bioinformatics interrogation
  of clinical datasets indicated that upregulated expression of TLR2 and SOD2 were
  significantly correlated in human GC, and the TLR2-SOD2 axis was associated with
  multiple clinical parameters of advanced stage disease, including distant metastasis,
  microvascular invasion and stage, as well as poor survival. Collectively, our findings
  reveal a novel TLR2-SOD2 axis as a potential biomarker for therapy and prognosis
  in cancer.
