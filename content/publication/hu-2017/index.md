abstract: Macrophages and dendritic cells initiate the innate immune response to infection
  and injury and contribute to inflammatory signaling to maintain the homeostasis
  of various tissues, which includes resident macrophages for the elimination of invading
  microorganisms and tissue damage. Inappropriate inflammatory signaling can lead
  to persistent inflammation and further develop into autoimmune and inflammation-associated
  diseases. Inflammatory signaling pathways have been well characterized, but how
  these signaling pathways are converted into sustained and diverse patterns of expression
  of cytokines, chemokines, and other genes in response to environmental challenges
  is unclear. Emerging evidence suggests the important role of epigenetic mechanisms
  in finely tuning the outcome of the host innate immune response. An understanding
  of epigenetic regulation of innate immune cell identity and function will enable
  the identification of the mechanism between gene-specific host defenses and inflammatory
  disease and will also allow for exploration of the program of innate immune memory
  in health and disease. This information could be used to develop therapeutic agents
  to enhance the host response, preventing chronic inflammation through preserving
  tissues and signaling integrity.
