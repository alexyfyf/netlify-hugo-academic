abstract: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death with gynecological malignancies.
  We aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis and biomarkers for
  cervical cancer by integrated bioinformatic analysis. We employed RNA-sequencing
  details of 254 cervical squamous cell carcinomas and 3 normal samples from The Cancer
  Genome Atlas. To explore the distinct pathways, messenger RNA expression was submitted
  to a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and protein–protein
  interaction network analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed. Then,
  we conducted pathway enrichment analysis for modules acquired in protein–protein
  interaction analysis and obtained a list of pathways in every module. After intersecting
  the results from the 3 approaches, we evaluated the survival rates of both mutual
  pathways and genes in the pathway, and 5 survival-related genes were obtained. Finally,
  Cox hazards ratio analysis of these 5 genes was performed. DNA replication pathway
  (P < .001; 12 genes included) was suggested to have the strongest association with
  the prognosis of cervical squamous cancer. In total, 5 of the 12 genes, namely,
  minichromosome maintenance 2, minichromosome maintenance 4, minichromosome maintenance
  5, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and ribonuclease H2 subunit A were significantly
  correlated with survival. Minichromosome maintenance 5 was shown as an independent
  prognostic biomarker for patients with cervical cancer. This study identified a
  distinct pathway (DNA replication). Five genes which may be prognostic biomarkers
  and minichromosome maintenance 5 were identified as independent prognostic biomarkers
  for patients with cervical cancer.
