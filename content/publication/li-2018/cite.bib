 abstract = {Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death with gynecological malignancies. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis and biomarkers for cervical cancer by integrated bioinformatic analysis. We employed RNA-sequencing details of 254 cervical squamous cell carcinomas and 3 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. To explore the distinct pathways, messenger RNA expression was submitted to a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and protein–protein interaction network analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed. Then, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis for modules acquired in protein–protein interaction analysis and obtained a list of pathways in every module. After intersecting the results from the 3 approaches, we evaluated the survival rates of both mutual pathways and genes in the pathway, and 5 survival-related genes were obtained. Finally, Cox hazards ratio analysis of these 5 genes was performed. DNA replication pathway (P < .001; 12 genes included) was suggested to have the strongest association with the prognosis of cervical squamous cancer. In total, 5 of the 12 genes, namely, minichromosome maintenance 2, minichromosome maintenance 4, minichromosome maintenance 5, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and ribonuclease H2 subunit A were significantly correlated with survival. Minichromosome maintenance 5 was shown as an independent prognostic biomarker for patients with cervical cancer. This study identified a distinct pathway (DNA replication). Five genes which may be prognostic biomarkers and minichromosome maintenance 5 were identified as independent prognostic biomarkers for patients with cervical cancer.},
