abstract: The identification of novel biomarkers of cancer is important for improved
  diagnosis and prognosis. With an abundant amount of resources in the publicly available
  database, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, an integrative strategy
  is used to systematically characterize the aberrant patterns of colorectal cancer
  (CRC) based on RNA-Seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), tissue
  microarray (TMA), gene profiling and molecular signatures. The expression of the
  transcription factor ATF3 was elevated in human CRC specimens in a TMA by immunochemistry
  analysis compared to the adjacent normal tissues. In addition, ATF3 overexpression
  associated with a regulatory molecular signature, and its functions are related
  to the pathogenic development of CRC. Furthermore, putative ATF3 regulatory elements
  were identified within the promoters of ATF3 target genes and were confirmed by
  ChIP-Seq. Critically, in higher ATF3 expression cell lines (HCT116 and RKO) with
  CRISPR/Cas9 mediated ATF3 knock out, we are able to show that ATF3 target genes
  such as CEACAM1, DUSP14, HDC, HLF and ULBP2, are required for invasion and proliferation,
  and they are robustly linked with poor prognosis in CRC. Our findings have important
  implications for CRC tumorigenesis and may be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic
  purposes.
