abstract: Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is
  widely used in studying chromatin biology, but a comprehensive review of the
  analysis tools has not been completed yet. Here, we discuss the major steps in
  ATAC-seq data analysis, including pre-analysis (quality check and alignment),
  core analysis (peak calling), and advanced analysis (peak differential
  analysis and annotation, motif enrichment, footprinting, and nucleosome
  position analysis). We also review the reconstruction of transcriptional
  regulatory networks with multiomics data and highlight the current challenges
  of each step. Finally, we describe the potential of single-cell ATAC-seq and
  highlight the necessity of developing ATAC-seq specific analysis tools to
  obtain biologically meaningful insights.
