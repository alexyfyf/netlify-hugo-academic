abstract: Several studies in the past decades have reported anti-tumor activity of
  the bioactive compounds extracted from tea leaves, with a focus on the compound
  epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). However, further investigations are required
  to unravel the underlying mechanisms behind the anti-tumor activity of EGCG. In
  this study, we demonstrate that EGCG significantly inhibits the growth of 4T1 breast
  cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. EGCG ameliorated immunosuppression by significantly
  decreasing the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increasing
  the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in spleen and tumor sites in 4T1 breast
  tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, a low dose of EGCG (0.5-5 µg/mL) effectively reduced
  the cell viability and increased the apoptosis rate of MDSCs in vitro. EGCG down-regulated
  the canonical pathways in MDSCs, mainly through the Arg-1/iNOS/Nox2/NF-$ąppa$B/STAT3
  signaling pathway. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis suggested that EGCG also affected
  the non-canonical pathways in MDSCs, such as ECM-receptor interaction and focal
  adhesion. qRT-PCR further validated that EGCG restored nine key genes in MDSCs,
  including Cxcl3, Vcan, Col4a1, Col8a1, Oasl2, Mmp12, Met, Itsnl and Acot1. Our results
  provide new insight into the mechanism of EGCG-associated key pathways/genes in
  MDSCs in the murine breast tumor model.
