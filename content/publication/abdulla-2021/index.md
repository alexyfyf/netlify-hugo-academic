abstract: The majority of cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) contain
  chromosomal abnormalities that drive overexpression of oncogenic transcription factors.
  However, whether these initiating oncogenes are required for leukemia maintenance
  is poorly understood. To address this, we developed a tetracycline-regulated mouse
  model of T-ALL driven by the oncogenic transcription factor Lmo2. This revealed
  that whilst thymus-resident pre-Leukemic Stem Cells (pre-LSCs) required continuous
  Lmo2 expression, the majority of leukemias relapsed despite Lmo2 withdrawal. Relapse
  was associated with a mature phenotype and frequent mutation or loss of tumor suppressor
  genes including Ikzf1 (Ikaros), with targeted deletion Ikzf1 being sufficient to
  transform Lmo2-dependent leukemias to Lmo2-independence. Moreover, we found that
  the related transcription factor TAL1 was dispensable in several human T-ALL cell
  lines that contain SIL-TAL1 chromosomal deletions driving its overexpression, indicating
  that evolution to oncogene independence can also occur in human T-ALL. Together
  these results indicate an evolution of oncogene addiction in murine and human T-ALL
  and show that loss of Ikaros is a mechanism that can promote self-renewal of T-ALL
  lymphoblasts in the absence of an initiating oncogenic transcription factor.
