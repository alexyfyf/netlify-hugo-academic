abstract: Current studies aiming at identifying single immune markers with prognostic
  value have limitations in the context of complex antitumor immunity and cancer immune
  evasion. Here, we show how the integration of several immune markers influences
  the predictions of prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients. We analyzed Tissue
  Microarray (TMA) by multiplex immunohistochemistry and measured the expression of
  immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 together with antitumor CD8 T cells and immune
  suppressive FOXP3 Treg cells in a cohort of GC patients. Unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering analysis of these markers was used to define correlations between CD8
  T, FOXP3 Treg and PD-L1 cell densities. We found that FOXP3 and PD-L1 densities
  were elevated while CD8 T cells were decreased in tumor tissues compared to their
  adjacent normal tissues. However, patient stratification based on each one of these
  markers individually did not show significant prognostic value on patient survival.
  Conversely, combination of the ratios of CD8/FOXP3 and CD8/PD-L1 enabled the identification
  of patient subgroups with different survival outcomes. As such, high densities of
  PD-L1 in patients with high CD8/FOXP3 and low CD8/PD-L1 ratios correlated with increased
  survival. Collectively, this work demonstrates the need for the integration of several
  immune markers to obtain more meaningful survival prognosis and patient stratification.
  In addition, our work provides insights into the complex tumor immune evasion and
  immune regulation by the tumor-infiltrating effector and suppressor cells, informing
  on the best use of immunotherapy options for treating patients.
