abstract: BACKGROUND Understanding immune phenotypes and human gastric disease in
  situ requires an approach that leverages multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC)
  with multispectral imaging to facilitate precise image analyses. METHODS We developed
  a novel 4-color mIHC assay based on tyramide signal amplification that allowed us
  to reliably interrogate immunologic checkpoints, including programmed death-ligand
  1 (PD-L1), cytotoxic T cells (CD8+T) and regulatory T cells (Foxp3), in formalin-fixed,
  paraffin-embedded tissues of various human gastric diseases. By observing cell phenotypes
  within the disease tissue microenvironment, we were able to determine specific co-localized
  staining combinations and various measures of cell density. RESULTS We found that
  PD-L1 was expressed in gastric ulcer and in tumor cells (TCs), as well as in tumor-infiltrating
  immune cells (TIICs), but not in normal gastric mucosa or other gastric intraepithelial
  neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, we found no significant reduction in CD8+T cells,
  whereas the ratio of CD8+T:Foxp3 cells and CD8+T:PD-L1 cells was suppressed in tumor
  tissues and elevated in adjacent normal tissues. An unsupervised hierarchical analysis
  also identified correlations between CD8+T and Foxp3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte
  (TIL) densities and average PD-L1 levels. Three main groups were identified based
  on the results of CD8+T:PD-L1 ratios in gastric tumor tissues. Furthermore, integrating
  CD8+T:Foxp3 ratios, which increased the complexity for immune phenotype status,
  revealed 6-7 clusters that enabled the separation of gastric cancer patients at
  the same clinical stage into different risk-group subsets. CONCLUSIONS Characterizing
  immune phenotypes in human gastric disease tissues via multiplexed immunohistochemistry
  may help guide PD-L1 clinical therapy. Observing unique disease tissue microenvironments
  can improve our understanding of immune phenotypes and cell interactions within
  these microenvironments, providing the ability to predict safe responses to immunotherapies.
