abstract: Phenolics, as the main bioactive compounds in tea, have been suggested to
  have potential in the prevention of various human diseases. However, little is known
  about phenolics and their bioactivity in Zhangping Narcissue tea cake which is considered
  the most special kind of oolong tea. To unveil its bioactivity, three phenolic-enriched
  extracts were obtained from Zhangping Narcissue tea cake using ethyl acetate, n-butanol,
  and water. Their main chemical compositions and in vitro bioactivity were analyzed
  by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The ethyl acetate fraction (ZEF) consisted of higher content
  of phenolics, flavonoids, procyanidins, and catechin monomers (including epigallocatechin
  gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG)) than
  n-butanol fraction (ZBF) and water fraction (ZWF). ZEF exhibited the strongest antioxidant
  capacity in vitro due to its abundant bioactive compounds. This was validated by
  Pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering analyses. ZEF also showed a remarkable
  inhibition on the growth, migration, and invasion of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells.
